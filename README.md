# 🏝️ Matrix Island Counter (Interactive)

A web-based tool to count the number of **islands** in a binary matrix of `0`s and `1`s. An island is formed by `1`s that are connected either:

- 🔲 **4-directionally** (up, down, left, right)
- 🔄 **8-directionally** (up, down, left, right, and diagonals)

Users can toggle between both modes interactively using a checkbox.
